Multi-Agent LangGraph System ðŸš€
This project implements a Multi-Agent LangGraph system using Streamlit, Hugging Face models, and PDF document processing to provide intelligent, query-based insights from uploaded documents.

Features:
PDF Upload: Upload a PDF and extract text for analysis.

Document Chunking: Text is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Advanced Retrieval: Retrieve relevant document chunks from the uploaded PDF to answer user queries.

Multi-Agent System: Utilizes a stateful graph of agents:

Retriever: Extracts relevant documents.

Reasoner: Summarizes or answers queries using a Hugging Face model.

Responder: Provides the final output from the analysis.

Hugging Face Integration: Leverages Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct for reasoning and natural language understanding.

Interactive UI: Users can interact with the system through a clean and intuitive Streamlit interface.

How It Works:
PDF Processing: Upload a PDF to extract text.

Text Splitting: The text is split into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Document Retrieval: Based on user input, the system retrieves relevant chunks from the PDF.

Analysis with LLM: The retrieved documents are passed to a Hugging Face model for summarization or answering questions.

Final Output: The model's response is displayed, providing insights directly from the uploaded document or generated by the model.

Technologies Used:
Streamlit: For building an interactive, user-friendly web interface.

LangChain: For document loading, splitting, and vectorization.

Hugging Face API: To leverage large pre-trained models for natural language understanding and text generation.

FAISS: For efficient vector storage and similarity search.
